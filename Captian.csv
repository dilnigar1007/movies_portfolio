It largely got a passing score by virtue of being an MCU movie. If it wasn't associated with Captain America The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy the criticism would've been much harsher.

4991,2022-06-18 15:53:54+00:00,MisterMB1988,Iron Man was a great movie because it examined a propaganda character. CA The First Avenger is weak because it goes yah Captain America and isn't even really good at it once it reaches its second half.

One of my faves is from Captain America: The First Avenger. ""People forget that the first country the Nazis invaded was their own."""

I really liked first half and the ending, second half was kinda worse, its where I totally zoomed out of the movie but still was okay and also the whole movie was so refreshing https://t.co/fO5aupq6cE"
